###Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but their "black-box" nature often makes them difficult to interpret. Concept Bottle-neck Layers (CBLs) address this by linking model outputs to human-understandable concepts. Our project introduces a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users, regardless of their technical background, to easily integrate CBLs into pre-trained LLMs (provided as .pt files), display top N highly activated concepts, and analyze and prune biased concepts. By identifying and unlearning biased concepts, these models can produce fairer, more reliable predictions. Our end goal is to provide users with the ability to scrutinize and adjust models to be explainable and fair. This work builds upon the research and framework developed by Weng et al. (2024).
